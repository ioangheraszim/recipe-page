## My process

Started project by setting up my files and diving into the design. Following it closely, I have broken down the design into distinct components piecing them together to create the whole design. Afterwords, I have applying the styling accordingly.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project has been a fantastic chance for me to dive back into familiar territory and brush up on skills I've already mastered. It's provided a hands-on opportunity to practice and refine my existing knowledge in a comfortable and enjoyable way.

### Continued development

Will study up on more concepts regarding CSS styling, JavaScript programming and React.js library.
